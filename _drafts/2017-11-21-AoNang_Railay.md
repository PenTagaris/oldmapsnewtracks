Ao Nang is a touristy city by the beach with a boardwalk-feel.  There are a plethora of bars and restaurants on the main strip, a big long beach, and not much to do unless you want to hop in a longtail boat or minibus to somewhere else.  We found ourselves here with four days to kill, and not a lot of money to spend (that's the problem with planning nothing beforehand; sometimes you end up with a week and no idea what to do with yourself).   So we became beach bums!  We spent our days and evenings walking around, lazing in the shade or in the water, and becoming intimately familiar with the cheap pad thai food carts on the street.

We did take a kayak tour one day, which was absolutely worth the money.  We paddled through a mangrove forest, watching sunning monitor lizards and narrowly avoiding getting mobbed by long tail macquaq monkeys who were very interested in any snacks we might be hiding.  We then paddled into a canyon, with towering limestone cliffs looming over us on both sides.  Not for the first time on this trip, we felt like we'd stumbled onto the set of an Indiana Jones movie!  Finally, we exited the canyon into the open sea, and paddled to our very own "private" (if you ignore the 25 other kayaks) beach.   It was a beautiful trip--definitely the highlight of our time in this part of the country!

After a few days we took a longtail boat to the next bay over, Railay Beach, which is famed for its huge limestone rock formations and world-class rock climbing.  The small strip of land by the beach is completely hemmed in by cliffs, so the only way to reach Railay is by boat.  We spent two days here exploring the many caves, lounging by the beach and doing a little hiking.  Justin tried his hand at climbing one morning, and made it 27 meters up one of the cliff faces!
