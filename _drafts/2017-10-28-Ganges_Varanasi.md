Ganges River and Varanasi

We groggily shuffled out of the night train after a semi-restful evening (Justin had nightmares about his house collapsing in an earthquake, Dana was trying to forget about the two rats fighting under the next seat).

A bus delivered us to our next interesting mode of conveyance: three small river boats and a kitchen boat, crewed by slim but very strong men who would row us down the river over the next two days and feed us the most delicious food along the way.

Our campsite was a sandy beach, deserted but for a few friendly stray dogs named Julie and Tiger by the boatmen.  You're not supposed to pet strays (rabies and all that) but we couldn't resist.

After some sweaty frisbee football, attempting to learn cricket but getting creamed by the natives, and enjoying a yummy dinner under the stars, we tucked into our tents to try to sleep in the sticky hot evening.  We didn't want to take a dip in the Ganges because it's so nasty.  My kingdom for a fan!

In the morning we continued to drift down the river for a few hours, and had the privilege of seeing a few of the pink river dolphins that live in the less populated parts of the Ganges.  Who knew that river could support life??  They're blind because of the high pollution levels in the river though, so maybe "support" is a strong word.

After leaving behind our friendly boatmen, we took a bus to one of the oldest cities in the world: Varanasi, which immediately struck us as having a different atmosphere that anywhere else we'd visited yet.  We saw a lot more tourists, but the area also had a hippy/artsy undercurrent.  The fact that it is a holy city permeates everything- even the cows here seem more peaceful.

There is a long river-front promenade running the length of the city, with steps down to the water, which is divided into sections called Ghats.  If you've seen pictures of people bathing in the Ganges, they were taken from one of these Ghats.  Cremations also take place here

Street art plasters the walls, advertising yoga studios, vegan bakeries, and peace and love, man.

We spent a few days absorbing all the brilliant colors, sights, and smells of the city before saying goodbye to Varanasi and heading to the border of Nepal.  It was probably our favorite city in India, and we were sorry to leave it but eager to see what awaited us in Nepal!
