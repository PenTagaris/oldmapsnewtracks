The final adventure we would share with our tour group was travelling to Kathmandu to see the many beautiful temples in the capital of Nepal.  The road through the mountains to Kathmandu, despite being the only road through that part of the country and therefore heavily traveled, is not a good one.  It hugs the steep mountainside, with a sharp dropoff to the river below always mere inches away from the tires of the car in the outisde lane (in this case us).  Construction to widen and pave the road has apparently been ongoing for years now, but the fact that the road is never closed and is populated by huge shipping trucks day and night has seriously hindered the pace of construction.  When we travelled it, one lane was closed for nearly the entire length of the road due to construction, so traffic was left to sqeeze into the outside lane,
