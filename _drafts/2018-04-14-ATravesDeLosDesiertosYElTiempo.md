Having had our fill of big city life for a while, we decided to scope out another part of the country. We figured that we could get to where we wanted to go pretty quickly while on a normal backpacker budget, especially if we hopped on a bus. This did not turn out to be the case. We discovered that our bus journey that would not only be expensive, but take over 28 hours. Argentinian roads, while well kept, cross some treacherous terrain, and the going can be slow when travelling cross country.

Flying would be another option, though there is no such thing as a "budget" airline in South America. This meant that we were looking at prices for a two hour round trip flight that were very nearly as expensive as our 13 hour flight back to the USA. We were all ready to go the bus route, as it was only "expensive", and not "you've gotta be kidding me," until we discovered a trick. We found that we could pay a significantly lower price for our tickets if we booked via the Argentinian version of the site, as opposed to the general English one. Thanks to Google Translate, we managed two tickets. We even still had enough left over for a rental car for a few days!

Our plane landed in Salta, which is sort of the gateway to nortwest Argentina. Salta is a well established city, and is in the process of finding its modern identity. That, or at least it's in the process of figuring out if a modern identity is worth the hassle. The avenues are filled with slow moving traffic, churches dot more corners than not, and cafes line the streets doling out caffeine and varities of tamales and empanadas, the latter being a regional specialty.

As we were walking around Salta, we began to realize something - we were only hearing Spanish. This might not seem surprising, but we had yet to encounter a place where the native tongue was the only one being spoken. English is especially common throughout the world, and we had heard and used it (with various degrees of success) in every country, city, and town we had been to so far. This was simply not the case in northwest Argentina, so it was a good thing we had been brushing up on our Spanish and had Google Translate downloaded!

Language barrier aside, we were able to get our rental car squared away, and we exited Salta en route to our next stop, Cafayate. Cafayate, located in Argentina's famed wine country, is on Route 40, one of the longest roads in the world. This road parallels the Andes mountains as it winds from the Argentinian border with Bolivia to the southern tip of South America, and passes through some stunning desert and mountain terrain. Justin had never seen anything like it before, and insisted on stopping every few minutes to take it all in, making the drive quite a bit longer than it needed to be!

After arriving in Cafayate, we checked in to our hostel, and set to exploring this charming little town in the shadow of a mountain. Wine is especially big near Cafayate, and we counted seven wineries that were walking distance from our hostel. We discovered a neat little restaurant called "Bad Brothers," which served wine and tapas as dinner. Here we sampled some of the best Malbec either of us had ever tasted, and had a great time, even though we were the only folks in the restaurant at 7:30.

Fortunately for our waistlines, Cafayate also offered plenty of walks and hikes for us to spend our days burning off previous nights' culinary indiscretions. One hike in particular turned into a "death march," something that we hadn't gotten a chance to do since Viet Nam. One of the requirements for a "death march" is that you have to get at least somewhat lost, and we certainly checked that box during this particular outing.

After getting turned around on several dead end burro trails, Justin decided that the best way to go was straight up the mountain, since we knew the trail continued on the other side. Dana, being the more reasonable one, cautioned against this, but Justin was already halfway up the mountain at this point. In a stunning display of bull-headedness and/or idiocy working out, we actually managed to get to the top of the mountain and find the trail again. Once back on track, we were able to find the waterfalls which this trail was famous for.

Our time in Cafayate had to come to an end, but we weren't quite done with this part of the world yet. We packed up and headed both further north and further up in elevation, over dirt roads and mountain passes towards the town of Purmamarca and the Argentinian salt flats.

We stayed in Purmamarca a few days in order to get used to the elevation. During our stay, we were reminded of a cardinal truth: a tourist trap is a tourist trap, no matter what the culture.

The road to the Argentinian salt flats is a two lane highway that consisted of steep roads, hairpin switchbacks, and big rigs. The road eventually crests the mountains at over 4000 meters (13,000 feet), but not before passing through the clouds. Driving through clouds is essentially driving through fog and rain all at the same time, and can lead to some interesting indentations on your steering wheel.

The salt flats are mind bending. Because the terrain is so flat, the landscape messes with your perspective. Additionally, it's pure white, so much so that it's easy to mistake the ground for snow-covered fields. After you get onto them, though, you realize that these more resemble plates than snow, and while it's somewhat moist when you step down, you're basically walking on rocks.

After braving high elevation, tourists traps, death marches, and the sheer number of different wines we had to sample, it was time to say good-bye. We got our rental car back to Salta, had one last meal, and skedaddled back to Buenos Aires to take a ferry over to our last country: Uruguay!
