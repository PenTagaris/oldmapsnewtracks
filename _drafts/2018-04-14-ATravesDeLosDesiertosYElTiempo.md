Having had our fill of big city life for a while, we decided to scope out another part of the county. We figured that we could get to where we wanted to go pretty quickly while on a normal backpacker budget, especially if we hopped on a bus. This did not turn out to be the case. We discovered that our bus journey that would not only be expensive, but take over 28 hours. Argentinian roads, while well kept, cross some treacherous terrain, and the going can be slow when travelling cross country.

Flying would be another option, though there is no such thing as a "budget" airline in South America. This meant that we were looking at prices for a two hour round trip flight that were very nearly as expensive as our 13 hour flight back to the USA. We were all ready to go the bus route, as it was only "expensive", and not "you've gotta be kidding me," until we discovered a trick. We found that we could pay a significantly lower price for our tickets if we booked via the Argentinian version of the site, as opposed to the general English one. Thanks to Google Translate, we managed two tickets. We even still had enough left over for a rental car for a few days!

Our plane landed in Salta, which is sort of the gateway to nortwest Argentina. Salta is a well established city, and is in the process of finding its modern identity. That, or at least it's in the process of figuring out if a modern identity is worth the hassle. The avenues are filled with slow moving traffic, churches dot more corners than not, and cafes line the streets doling out caffeine and varities of tamales, as well as empanadas, the regional specialty.

After a day in Salta, we went to get our rental car, and a realization began to dawn on us. English is a pretty common language amongst travellers from all countries, and it had therefore been common for us to hear it, even in more rural places like Sa Pa and Orchha. This was not the case in Salta, so it was a good thing we had been studying Spanish, and had Google Translate downloaded!

Language barrier aside, we were able to get our rental car squared away, and we exited Salta en route to our next stop, Cafayate. Cafayate is on Route 40, which has become famous due to the number of vineyards and wineries that it takes you to. Cafayate itself was home to
