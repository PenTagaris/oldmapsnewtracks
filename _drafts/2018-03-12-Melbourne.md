A lot has changed in Melbourne since its early days as a gold-mining town on the very fringes of civilization.  For one thing: its name.  The original name of the city was supposed to be, get this, Batmania!  It was supposed be named after its founder, John Batman, but the Aussies were trying to curry favor with the British crown at the time, so ended up naming it after Lord Melbourne instead.  Which is how we missed out on having one of the greatest city names in history.

Melbourne feels like a global city now, but it still holds on to a little bit of that fringe element that makes it feel different.  Alleyways filled with beautiful street art, trendy speakeasies, and odd street performers mix with delicious food options from all corners of the globe, stunning and strange museums, and cool modern architecture to create a flavor that is unique to this city.

Considering it was midsummer in Australia, we expected every day to be sunny and hot, so we were surprised by how much rain the city gets!  Apparently the weather can be unpredictable and nasty all year long." %}

We stayed at a hostel that was in an old converted nunnery (very cool buiding, but definitely one of the grosser hostels we stayed in) in the Fitzroy neighborhood, which is one of the trendier neighborhoods of the city.  It's surrounded by hip bars, hole-in-the-wall restaurants, and clothes shops full of fashions we would never in a million years be able to pull off.  The park across the street from the hostel was a favorite evening roosting spot for huge fruit bats (we're talking like a three foot wingspan), which would come winging in to land at dusk each night like miniature squeaking dragons.  We had so much fun watching them!

We spent our days wandering around the city, exploring all the little alleyways and finding as much cheap food as we could.  Food is nearly as expensive as alchohol in this city, so we couldn't afford to explore much of the world-class dining options, but we found our fair share of cheep yummy street food!

We splurged and spent the $30 pp to enjoy the Melbourne Museum for a day.  It was definitely worth it; there were some really unique exhibits, as well as the usual natural history section full of creepy stuffed animals.

We wanted to see some of the surrounding countryside while we were here, so started looking into how far out of the city public transportation could get us.  We found a small national park called Organ Pipes which we could get to by taking a train and then a bus, so we decided to finally pop our "no city buses" cherry.
