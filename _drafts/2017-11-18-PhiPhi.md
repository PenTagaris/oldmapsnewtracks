Koh Lanta was the perfect place to chill for a week, but we decided we were a little curious about the famous party islands of Thailand.  Maybe just for a day or so, just to see what it was like.  We hopped a ferry to Koh Phi Phi, which is known for its lovely white sand beaches, beautiful diving and snorkeling, and crazy nightlife.

After the two nights we had booked at the hotel were up, we decided we weren't quite ready to leave yet...there was just something so enticing about how easy everything is here.  You want live music, beautiful beaches, jungle hiking, fun bars, yummy food?  All are cheap and at your fingertips.  It was also nice that the whole island was pedestrian friendly, with almost no motor vehicles.
