We had heard from several fellow travellers that Vietnam was an beautiful, enriching country full of wonderful, friendly people and delicious food. As we did some research however, we  read more than a few accounts which indicated that Vietnam was home to some of the meanest people the authors had ever met, their only joy in life scamming, or outright pickpocketing, unsuspecting tourists. After absorbing these differing accounts, we really had no idea what to expect as we set down in Hanoi.

We made it through immigration unscathed, and much faster than we had anticipated. After a 40 minute drive to our hostel, we hopped out and saw what was likely a spectacular lake in the middle of the city, shrouded in darkness. Exhausted from the days' travel, we didn't do much besides check in hotel and fall asleep.
