We returned to Ha Noi for an international flight, and took a night or two to further explore the city's nightlife offerings. The "party" hostel we stayed in afforded some cheap beer and recommendations on where to go for our last 48 hours in Ha Noi. We accepted the beer, and ignored the recommendations. We'd done a bunch of the cultural stops, and found posting up at a cafe with a Vietnamese coffee and people watching to be far more enlightening and entertaining.

There are some people who enjoy flying. Good on them. From our perspective it's hard to see the upside to a 19 hour airplane marathon.
