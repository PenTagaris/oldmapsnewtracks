Ireland's reputation as the "Emeral Isle" may seem overblown if one just stays in Dublin and the closely surrouding areas. A trip to the Ring of Kerry will quickly disabuse anyone of this notion; however, small and windy roads, coupled with large and lumbering tour buses, makes the trip more exciting than perhaps it should be.

Hills, meadows and valleys go on as far as the eye can see, and even in the rainiest of weather, the verdant landscape boasts some of the deepest greens imaginable. No where is this more apparent than at the Gap of Dunloe, where Dana met her new best friend, Bobfred.

Our travels on the Ring led us to the small town of Cahersiveen, which is a small town with a castle, and two small rock forts, all dating back several centuries.o
