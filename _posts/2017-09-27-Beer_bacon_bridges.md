Prague is the original hipster’s paradise--it is Bohemia after all!  No one has told the Czech though, not a man bun in sight amongst the locals.  The beer is fresh and dirt cheap, bacon and other delicious smoked meats are everywhere, and the music is funky.  We’ve already stumbled into several underground bars that look like bunkers leftover from WWII (probably because they are).

*We’ve seen a few ads for these beer spas… so many questions.  Do you drink the beer you’re swimming in?*

*This is a traditional Czech meal- lots of meat!  Justin has svíčková omáčka, which is a beef sirloin in cream sauce, served with dumplings, cranberries, and whipped cream.  It’s a mix of sweet and salty, just as heavy as it sounds, and really delicious!  Dana has smoked pork belly (basically meat candy) with cabbage and potatoes.*

We’re staying at a hostel this week, which besides the price really has its perks!  We’ve taken advantage of the free city walking tour and a free comedy show, and have made a lot of friends who are on similar adventures as us, quitting their jobs and traveling like crazy people.  There are quite a few Americans staying here, as well as some Aussies and a few Canadians.  We’ve had some fun nights out with everyone, and since a lot of them are here until this weekend like us, there should be more to come!

We also took a castle tour, which gave us the historical highlights of the huge palace/citadel complex on the hill overlooking the city.  It was nice to have some context for all the beautiful buildings we were seeing.

*The St. Vitus Cathedral, part of the royal palace complex which is advertised as the largest castle in the world.  You do have to go through security, but then you can walk all around the palace pretty much freely.*

*Inside the Cathedral.  Building was started in 1344 and not completed until 1929, a serious labor of love!*

*The Titan’s Gate guarding the entrance, where you can see the Titans beating the crap out of anyone evil trying to enter the castle.*

*We ended our tour at the John Lennon Wall, where Justin got to add to the graffiti.  The wall is named because while the city was in the grip of communism, the Beatles were taboo and seen as a sign of evil capitalism.  In protest people started tagging anti-communist messages on this wall, and today they just tag anything they like.*

So far we love Prague, and it's a good thing we have a week here, there's so much more to explore!
