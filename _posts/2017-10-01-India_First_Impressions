India First Impressions

New Delhi is a city of striking contrast.  We checked into our hotel right by the airport at 7 AM after waiting in the immigration line for 3 hours, and found a luxury hotel worthy of Las Vegas, infinity pool included (and this was the cheapest hotel option near the airport; it cost about $100 per night).  We left that afternoon to walk to the metro, which was a few blocks from the hotel.  Right outside the heavily guarded security gates was a much different world. We found the metro station near a busy highway in the middle of a dirt clearing, and walked inside to go through yet more security checks and buy our tokens.  Dogs covered in flies lay on the floor, looking about 5 minutes from death.

As soon as we got underground in the metro, a clean, brand-new looking station greeted us.  A train pulled up within seconds, also looking practically brand-new.  The metro was easy and efficient, seemingly much more so than the D.C. metro!  It got us to within a few blocks of our next hotel in about an hour, where we got to walk along a busy, very dusty highway for a short ways.  Thankfully we didn't have to cross any of the highways- we were not ready for that adventure yet, although we did see a lot of locals attempting it!

The poverty is very real and very visible here, and it is all the more jarring when contrasted with the smoothly running metro, the sparkling white apartment towers on the horizon, the many advertisements for luxury brands featuring beautiful pale-skinned Indians.  All you have to do is look out the window to see that this is not the world most people live in.  Theirs is a world of shanty towns, dust and trash choked streets, no running water; and these are just the things we can see on the surface.
