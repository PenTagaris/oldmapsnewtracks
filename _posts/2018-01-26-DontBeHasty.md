We thought two weeks would be plenty of time to see the sights on the south island, but it turns out you could easily spend two years exploring here.  So we passed the days doing a lot of driving, trying to fit in all the sights we wanted to see.  Our path took us from the beautiful high lake country in the center of the island, throught Queenstown, down to the fjords and rainforest of the Millford Sound area, and finally to the very southern tip of the island in the hopes of seeing some penguins.  Mostly we spent our time driving and enjoying the scenery, or walking and enjoying the scenery, or hanging out in camp with a beer and enjoying the scenery.  We don't really have any exciting stories from this week, so we'll let the photos do the talking!

According to local legend, it was named after a lovely lady back in the gold rush days who was carried home from a bar and protested mightily over being carried across the river.  See all the dead pine trees on the slopes?  They've been sprayed with a pesticide to kill them.  They're invasive here, and the government is taking steps to eradicate them." %}

Not sure if they're the best burgers in the world, as many say, but since we'd been living on ramen (and the occasional trout) for the past week, they were absolutely amazing!" %}

We took a hike along the Waiau River, in the southwest of the island, in an attempt to find some LOTR film locations!  We never found exact locations, that might be impossible given the size of these areas, but a lot of places seemed familiar.

After pretending to be hobbits lost in the Dead Marshes, we made our way up the glacial valley towards Millford Sound.  A lot of people use Millford Sound as a launching point to take cruises of the fjords in the southern part of the island, but we had heard the drive to the Sound was impressive in its own right.  We were not disappointed!  This may have been one of our most beautiful drives yet, which is saying something in NZ.

We drove all up and down this valley looking for a campsite that wasn't packed to the gills with other campers.  This one was mysteriously completely empty despite the stunning view and lack of sand flies.  We were more than happy to have the place to ourselves." %}

{% include postpic.html file="IMG_20171207_114450.jpg" caption="We've reached the end of the valley now, and the big granite peaks are looming right over our heads.

Before we started making our way up to the northernmost point of the South island to catch a ferry to the North island, we decided we absolutely had to see penguins.  They were a little out of our way... 6 hours each way... but totally worth it!  Ok in reality, probably not worth it.  We had two days to make the drive there and back, and in the end we only saw one penguin about 500 feet away on the beach far below.  Oh well, the scenery was pretty at least!

{% include postpic.html file="IMG_20171208_165142.jpg" caption="Roaring Bay, where penguins nest year-round.  We saw one little guy heading out to the ocean, but he was so far away he just looked like a waddling speck." %}

{% include postpic.html file="IMG_20171209_1.jpg" caption="It was time for the long drive back through the center of the country to the west coast.  We had dinner in the van because it was pouring rain out, but as we were finishing eating another camper tapped on our window and pointed exitedly outside.  We came stumbling out and saw this beautiful rainbow!  Justin wanted a photo of the whole arc, so he started running up the road to get a better shot...forgetting that he wasn't wearing shoes.  He stepped on a stick and got a nice slice in the bottom of his foot.  And that's how Justin hurt himself chasing a rainbow." %}
